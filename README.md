# CuriosityLab
Nothing serious. Just a random repository fuelled by curiosity

## What's this about?
instead of overthinking, I just do it. This repo is home to:

- **Quick experiments:** Tiny projects that don't take forever.
- **Weird ideas:** Stuff that's fun to code, even if it makes no sense.
- **Skill tests:** Seeing if I can pull something off.
